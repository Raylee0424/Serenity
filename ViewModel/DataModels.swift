        ‚Ä¢ Sleep disturbances
        
        **Effective Management Strategies:**
        1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - Helps identify and challenge negative thought patterns
        2. Mindfulness Meditation - 10 minutes daily can reduce stress hormones by up to 30%
        3. Regular Exercise - Boosts endorphins and improves stress resilience
        4. Breathing Techniques - 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4s, hold 7s, exhale 8s)
        
        Recent studies show combining lifestyle changes with professional support can reduce anxiety symptoms by 60% within 3 months. Remember - occasional anxiety is normal, but persistent symptoms warrant professional consultation.
